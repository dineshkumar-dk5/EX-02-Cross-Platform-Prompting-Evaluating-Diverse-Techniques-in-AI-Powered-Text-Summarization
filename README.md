# Ex.No: 2 	Evaluation of 2024 Prompting Tools Across Diverse AI Platforms: ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta 

# üìä EVALUATION OF 2024 PROMPTING TOOLS ACROSS DIVERSE AI PLATFORMS

## AIM

Within a specific use case (summarizing text), compare the **performance, user experience, and response quality** of prompting tools across different AI platforms: **ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini (Bard), Cohere Command, and Meta‚Äôs LLaMA models**.

---

## AI TOOLS REQUIRED

* **ChatGPT-4.5 / GPT-4-turbo** (OpenAI)
* **Claude 3 (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)** (Anthropic)
* **Gemini (Bard)** (Google)
* **Cohere Command R+ / R+ Light**
* **Meta LLaMA 3-based models** (via Mistral/Perplexity.ai, or Meta‚Äôs own)

## INTRODUCTION TO PROMPTING TOOLS IN AI PLATFORMS

As LLMs (Large Language Models) have become more powerful, **prompt engineering** has emerged as a key skill. Prompting tools such as **zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, instructional, role-based, and self-reflective prompting** allow users to structure input for clearer and more relevant responses.

Each platform has different **strengths**:

* **OpenAI (ChatGPT)**: advanced role prompts, API function calling.
* **Anthropic (Claude)**: long context handling, safety alignment.
* **Google (Gemini/Bard)**: broad web integration, conversational style.
* **Cohere (Command R)**: enterprise NLP focus, retrieval-augmented tools.
* **Meta (LLaMA)**: open-source flexibility but limited polish.

## METHODOLOGY OF COMPARISON

**Use Case:** Summarizing a complex document.
**Prompt:**

1. *Step 1:* ‚ÄúSummarize the following 500-word article on **The Basics of Blockchain Technology** in 120‚Äì150 words for undergraduate students. Keep it clear and beginner-friendly.‚Äù
2. *Step 2:* ‚ÄúPlease revise the summary to make it even simpler and include at least two real-world examples of blockchain applications.‚Äù

**Evaluation Criteria:**

* **Response Quality:** Accuracy, clarity, relevance.
* **Performance:** Speed, reliability, consistency.
* **User Experience:** Ease of interaction, prompt sensitivity.
* **Customization:** Ability to refine with feedback.

---

## RESULTS

### **Step 1 ‚Äì Initial Summaries (120‚Äì150 words)**

* **ChatGPT:** Clear, structured, included decentralization, immutability, applications, and challenges.
* **Claude:** Concise, academic tone, accurate, but less engaging.
* **Gemini (Bard):** General and conversational, sometimes vague.
* **Cohere:** Technical style, precise but less accessible for undergraduates.
* **Meta LLaMA:** Short, sometimes missed key points.

### **Step 2 ‚Äì Simplified with Real-World Examples**

* **ChatGPT:** Used metaphors like *‚Äúdigital notebook‚Äù*, included Bitcoin + Walmart examples, very student-friendly.
* **Claude:** Simplified well, added supply chain and healthcare examples, but less metaphorical.
* **Gemini (Bard):** Added real-world use cases but oversimplified technical details.
* **Cohere:** Clearer with examples after feedback, still somewhat formal.
* **Meta LLaMA:** Provided short examples but lacked depth.
